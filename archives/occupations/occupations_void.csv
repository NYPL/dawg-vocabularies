dcterms:title,Index Terms for Occupations in Archival and Manuscript Collections
dcterms:description,"Index terms for occupations in archival and manuscript collections (ITOAMC) is a controlled vocabulary maintained as an Excel spreadsheet by Manuscript Division of the Library of Congress for use in authority and bibliographic records. New terms are added about once every two years.[1] Folger catalogers sometimes use ITOAMC terms in authority records. The MARC source code is itoamc, but online searching reveals this is often typo'd as ""itomac."""
